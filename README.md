(https://plsenh.github.io/Psychic-Game/)

In this game, a random letter is determined as the secret answer every round.

The user has up to ten tries per round to get the correct answer. A guess is made when a user types a letter.

Repeated guesses in a round will not decrease the remaining guess count.
